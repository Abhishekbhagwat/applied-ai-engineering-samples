# Google Cloud Applied AI Engineering

This repo contains Generative AI / GenAI code examples, demos, educational and training content, notebooks, and other technical materials built by the Google Cloud Applied AI Engineering team. 

* **[Tuning Foundational Models with Vertex AI](./assets/vertex_foundation_tuning/README.md)**: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook illustrating the step-by-step procedure for tuning foundational models (PaLM 2) with Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Guides users through the entire setup and integration process â€“ starting from environment setup, foundational model selection, to tuning it with Vertex AI.
* **[Langchain Observability Code Snippet](./assets/langchain_observability_snippet/README.md)**: A [Langchain callback](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/callbacks/) to aid with understanding/observing the exact LLM calls made by a Langchain agent. The callback is provided in a Jupyter notebook, which also includes a demonstration of the code snippet.
* **[Advanced Prompting Training](./assets/advanced_prompting_training/README.md)**: A detailed notebook on prompt engineering, demonstrating and explaining chain of thought and ReAct (reasoning + acting) prompting. Chain of thought is a very low-effort way to improve prompt performance, and ReAct is the state-of-the-art for using LLMs to interact with external systems.
* **[Vertex AI LLM Evaluation Services](./assets/vertex_evaluation_services/README.md)**: We offer a comprehensive set of notebooks that demonstrate how to use Vertex AI LLM Evaluation Services in conjunction with other Vertex AI services. Additionally, we have provided notebooks that delve into the theory behind evaluation metrics.
