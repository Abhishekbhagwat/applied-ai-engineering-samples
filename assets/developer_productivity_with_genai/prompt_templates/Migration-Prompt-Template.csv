Basic Migration,"You are great at migrating code from COBOL to Java. Here is the COBOL code: {cobol_file}

Please covert it to Java by following the prompt instructions below to do that:

Step 1: Generate Java classes from COBOL data structures. Each COBOL data structure should correspond to a Java class. Ensure proper data type mapping and encapsulation.

Step 2: Translate COBOL file input/output operations to Java file handling operations

Step 3: Migrate COBOL business logic to Java. Convert COBOL procedures, paragraphs, and sections to Java methods. Ensure equivalent functionality

Step 4: Convert COBOL conditional statements (IF, ELSE, etc.) to Java if-else statements and loops (PERFORM, etc.) to Java loops (for, while, etc.). Ensure logical equivalence

Step 5: Replace COBOL-specific functions and operations with Java equivalents. This includes arithmetic operations, string manipulations, and date/time functions.

Step 6: Generate Java constants from COBOL copybooks. Each COBOL constant should be converted to an equivalent Java constant

Step 7: Update COBOL variable names and identifiers to follow Java naming conventions. Ensure proper camelCase or PascalCase formatting"
Tests for Migration,Generate a few unit test cases and data to validate the migrated Java code. Ensure that the Java code functions correctly and produces the same results as the original COBOL code.
Refactoring for Migration,"Refactor the generated Java code to adhere to Java best practices, coding standards, and design patterns. Optimize the code for performance and maintainability"
Documentation for Migration,"Generate documentation for the code migration process. Include details of the changes made, data type mappings, and any issues encountered during migration"
